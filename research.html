  <h1>Research</h1>

 
  <p>
  My primary area of research is probability theory. I study phase transitions and extrema of spin glasses and other high-dimensional random fields. My current work utilizes Kac-Rice tools, and how to extend some of these tools to study the local optima of short-range spin glasses on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. 
</p>

  <p>

Studying these objects often reduces to studying the random matrices that describe them. A large part of my research is therefore focused on the spectral laws of large random matrices, specifically non-Hermitian random matrices with an elliptic covariance structure.
